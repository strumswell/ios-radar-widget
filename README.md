# Oscar Weather for iOS

An iOS weather app written with SwiftUI. You can view current and forecasted weather for your current or custom locations. This includes current condition, rain intensity chart for the next hour (central Europe only), air quality, hourly, and 10-day forecast. An integrated rain radar (widget) and multiple other map layers allow you to track the current weather conditions. This app is not intended for production and has a lot of room for improvement.
