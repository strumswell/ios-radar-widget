# Oscar Weather App for iOS
This iOS weather app is written with SwiftUI. It is far from finished and should not be used in production.

Features: 
- Rather finished UI
- Weather data from OpenWeatherMap of current location through my api proxy (currently, minutely rain forcast, hourly, daily)
- Current rain radar (native in app, via snapshot api in widget -> tbc!)

Todo: Settings, location picker, time travel with rain radar, native rain radar widget, other widgets
