# Oscar Weather for iOS

An iOS 17 SwiftUI weather app, offering superior accuracy for Europe compared to Apple Weather. View current and forecasted weather for your current or custom locations, including current conditions, a rain intensity chart for the next two hours (central Europe only), weather alerts (Germany only), air quality, hourly and 12-day forecasts. An integrated rain radar widget and multiple map layers help you track current weather conditions. Note: this app is still in development and not intended for production.
